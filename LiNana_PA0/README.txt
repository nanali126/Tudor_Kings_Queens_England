This program is to read the relatives relationship from an external file and to check the ancestors and de3cesdants of the 
determined family member. 

In this program, I created two objects which are member and family. Member is an object stroing member's name and who are 
his or her decesdants and ancestor. The family is an object which is an arraylist which store every members in this family. 
The Relatives class is the main class.

To start this program, the user should type in the external file in the console and type in the name of which family member
need to be checked who are his or her ancestors and decsdants. 

For example, the user firstly type in the "tudor.txt" and then "Margaret". The user will get the result of Margaret's ancestors and decsdants
based on the tudor.txt. The result will show all of her ancestors and decesdants.
